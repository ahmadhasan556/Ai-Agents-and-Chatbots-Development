    "### Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to get accurate, useful, and reliable outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "A well-structured prompt guides the model’s reasoning and helps avoid irrelevant or incorrect answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 Types of Prompting\n",
    "1. Zero-Shot Prompting\n",
    "In zero-shot, the model is asked to perform a task without being given any prior examples.\n",
    "It relies entirely on the instructions in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Example **\n",
    "\n",
    "Translate this sentence into French:\n",
    "\"I love learning artificial intelligence.\" \n",
    "2. Few-Shot Prompting\n",
    "In few-shot, the model is given a few examples to learn the pattern before answering.\n",
    "This helps the model generalize better for the desired task.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Example **\n",
    "\n",
    "Translate the following sentences into French:\n",
    "\n",
    "English: Good morning\n",
    "French: Bonjour\n",
    "\n",
    "English: How are you?\n",
    "French: Comment ça va?\n",
    "\n",
    "English: I am learning AI\n",
    "French: \n",
    "3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting\n",
    "Chain-of-Thought prompting encourages the model to show intermediate reasoning steps before giving the final answer.\n",
    "This is especially useful for math, logic, and multi-step reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt:  If a pen costs $2 and a notebook costs $5, how much do 3 pens and 2 notebooks cost?\n",
    "Explain step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:  \n",
    "Step 1: Cost of 3 pens = 3 × $2 = $6\n",
    "Step 2: Cost of 2 notebooks = 2 × $5 = $10\n",
    "Step 3: Total = $6 + $10 = $16\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: $16\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought Prompting\n",
    "Combines examples with reasoning steps to maximize accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt:  \n",
    "Q: If there are 4 apples and you eat 1, how many are left?\n",
    "A: Step 1: Start with 4 apples.\n",
    "Step 2: Eat 1 apple.\n",
    "Step 3: 4 - 1 = 3.\n",
    "Answer: 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Now solve:\n",
    "Q: A box has 10 chocolates. You give 3 to a friend. How many are left?\n",
    "Output: \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Role/Persona Prompting\n",
    "The model is asked to act as a specific role (teacher, doctor, developer, etc.) to shape its responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt: \n",
    "You are an expert Python developer.\n",
    "Explain how a \"for loop\" works to a beginner.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "A \"for loop\" repeats code a certain number of times. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",
    "print(\"Hello\")\n",
    "\n",
    "This will print \"Hello\" three times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Summary\n",
    "Zero-Shot → No examples, direct task.\n",
    "Few-Shot → Provide a few examples.\n",
    "Chain-of-Thought → Ask for reasoning steps.\n",
    "Few-Shot + CoT → Examples + reasoning.\n",
    "Role Prompting → Assign a persona for context.\n",
    "Prompt engineering is about guiding the model’s reasoning to improve accuracy, consistency, and reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangChain\n",
    "Definition\n",
    "LangChain is a framework for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides tools to connect models with external data sources, memory, and reasoning chains, making LLMs more practical and powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangGraph\n",
    "Definition\n",
    "LangGraph is a framework built on top of LangChain that allows developers to design, visualize, and control the flow of AI applications as graphs, making complex multi-step reasoning and agent workflows easier to manage."
